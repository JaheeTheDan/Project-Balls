# Project-Balls
A python script that plays an audio file (I chose balls with some reverb) when the keyword (I chose "balls") is reregistered  

This program allows an audio file to play when a keyword is trigger, the audio and keyword can be anything that the user want (with some changes with the script by the user. 
This can be run in the background and without computer user knowledge (so a bit of trolling) but with some changes or running in 'cmd' with & pythonw main.py

PS. Python is needed to be installed on system in order to work and the python libraries installed 'just_playback' and 'keyboard'.
